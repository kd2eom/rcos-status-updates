## Last Week's Accomplishments

I finished configuring Shuttle Tracker on my local machine by adding all the routes, stops, and vehicles. I also downloaded the code that Frank wrote for the ETA Python scripts so that I can start working with them.

## This Week's Plan

We currently have a Python script that calculates the average velocity of a shuttle based on the day of the week and route. I will experiment with using several different heuristics to calculate the average velocity and see if any of the other different heuristics yield significantly different results. Based on this data, we should be able to determine which heuristic is most accurate in terms of calculating the average velocity which will be used in the algorithm that computes the ETA. Before I do this, I also have to study our current Python script and figure out how it works. If I am able, I will also add comments to the Python script so that other contributors will know what it does. I will begin working on all of this this week, but I anticipate I will not be finished within that time.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking as of yet.
