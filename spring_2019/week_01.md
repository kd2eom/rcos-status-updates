## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over the past week, I installed Shuttle Tracker onto my local machine and forked the Shuttle Tracker repo onto my GitHub account. I was also introduced to my team and told what we will be doing.

## This Week's Plan

Exact details to be determined at the next meeting, but we will being writing/testing the ETA feature for Shuttle Tracker in Python.

## Anything Blocking?

My group leader needs to commit some changes before we can begin coding; after that, he will either send me the new files or have me fork from his branch, and I can pick an assignment and start working.
